# Physics Simulator V2 by TJDA1

## Common
Common contains configuration variables and helpers that display on the main window. Editing config will change the base settings that the simulation runs on including how the objects interact with each other and with the boundaries of the system. Interface defines the UI manager and elements that help dynamically change the paramters of the system through the render window.

### ```config.py```
Config includes 4 subsections: the parameters of the render window, none of which can be changed while the program is running due to the limitations of pygame. The parameters of the gravity affecting objects universally in the simulation, which can be all be edited by UI elements. ```gmag``` measures gravitational acceleration in simulation units / second<sup>2</sup>, in the direction ```deg``` which starts at 0 pointing to the left side of the render window, and rotates clockwise. ```spinvel``` is a test variable.
